## Exporting data
Once you have finished working with a data set in OpenRefine you may wish to export it. The export options are accessed through the ```Export``` button at the top right of the OpenRefine interface.

Export formats support include HTML, Excel and comma- and tab-separated value (csv and tsv). You can also write a custom export, selecting to export specific fields, adding a header or footer and specifying the exact format.
