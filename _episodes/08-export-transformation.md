## Saving and Exporting a Project

In OpenRefine you can save or export the project. This means you're saving the data and all the 
information about the cleaning and data transformation steps you've done. Once you've saved a project, you can
open it up again and be just where you stopped before.

### Saving

By default OpenRefine is saving your project. If you close OpenRefine and open it up again,
you'll see a list of your projects. You can click on any one of them to open it up again.

### Exporting

Once you have finished working with a data set in OpenRefine you may wish to export it. The export options are accessed through the ```Export``` button at the top right of the OpenRefine interface.

Export formats support include HTML, Excel and comma- and tab-separated value (csv and tsv). You can also write a custom export, selecting to export specific fields, adding a header or footer and specifying the exact format.
