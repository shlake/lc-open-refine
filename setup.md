## Getting ready

You need to download and install OpenRefine and download a data file to follow this lesson.

### Downloading OpenRefine

You can download OpenRefine from [http://openrefine.org/download.html](http://openrefine.org/download.html). This lesson has been tested with all versions of OpenRefine, from 2.5 to 2.7.  

OpenRefine 2.7 is recommended.  

There are versions for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.

### Installing and Running OpenRefine

When you download OpenRefine for Windows or Linux from the address above, you are downloading a zip file. To install OpenRefine you simply unzip the downloaded file wherever you want to install the program. This can be to a personal directory or to an applications or software directory - OpenRefine should run wherever you put the unzipped folder. The location has to be a "local" drive as problems have been reported trying to run OpenRefine from a Network drive.

If you are downloading OpenRefine for Mac, you are downloading a 'dmg' (disk image) file which you can open, and then drag the OpenRefine application to an appropriate folder on you computer.

**OpenRefine is a Java application, and you need to have a 'Java Runtime Environment' (JRE) installed on your computer to run OpenRefine**. If you don’t already have one installed then you can download and install from [http://java.com](http://java.com) by going to the site and clicking "Free Java Download".

To run Refine:

* On Windows: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine and either double-click ‘google-refine.exe’ (for Google Refine 2.5), ’openrefine.exe’ (for OpenRefine 2.7) or ‘refine.bat’ (for either)
* On Linux: Navigate to the folder where you’ve installed OpenRefine in a terminal window and type ‘./refine’
* On Mac: Navigate to where you installed OpenRefine and click the OpenRefine icon

The interface to OpenRefine is accessed via a web browser. When you run Refine normally this should open a window in your default web browser pointing at the address http://127.0.0.1:3333. If this doesn't happen automatically you can open a web browser and type in this address.

### Getting Help

If you encounter problems installing or running OpenRefine, a good source of support is [the OpenRefine mailing list and forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/openrefine)

If you are installing OpenRefine on Windows, you may want to check the thread on [Installing OpenRefine on Windows 7](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!searchin/openrefine/64-bit%7Csort:date/openrefine/vUzqJqJ-sAA/Tb2Om9wvaqgJ)

### Downloading the data

There are a number of ways to get the data we will be using in OpenRefine.

1. Once you have started OpenRefine, use this link [http://shlake.github.io/lc-open-refine-short/data/doaj-article-sample.xlsx](http://shlake.github.io/lc-open-refine-short/data/doaj-article-sample.xlsx) to import the data directly into OpenRefine using the **Web Addresses URLs** option.

2. You can download [doaj-article-sample.xlsx](http://shlake.github.io/lc-open-refine-short/data/doaj-article-sample.xlsx), which is a xlsx file that should automatically download. You may need to right click or control click in order to save the file (NOTE: In Safari, right click and select **download linked file**; in Chrome and Firefox, right click and select **save link as**). Make a note of the location (i.e the folder, your desktop) to which you save the file.
