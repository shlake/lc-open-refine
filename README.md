# Library Carpentry - Southeast Data Librarians Symposium

https://shlake.github.io/lc-open-refine-short/

This version of the Library Carpentry Openrefine workshop is a shortened version of the Original Library Carpentry Workshop. Please see the bottom section on information and links to the Original lesson.

## Rational

The original LC workshop is scheduled for 3+ hours. This version of Openrefine was shortened in length to teach in 75 minutes. I encourage ALL Southeast Data Librarians to work through the sections in the original LC workshop that were omitted due to time constraints.

## Topics Not Covered in this Shortened Version

- Clustering
- Columns & Sorting
- Spliting cells
- Handling Arrays
- Advanced OpenRefine functions (reconciliation)

To learn about these topics, see the complete lesson:
